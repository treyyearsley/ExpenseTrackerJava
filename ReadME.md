# Overview
I wrote an expense tracker program in Java. The program allows the user to enter expense 
in several different expense categories. The program also asks the user for their desired budget 
for that specific category and it will compare total expenses and desired budget. I
wrote this program to learn and practice my java skills.

# Development Environment

I used the Java 21 package and used intelliJ as the operator. I used git and github to stored and share
the program.

I used two libraries for this project that are part of the Java language. I used ArrayList 
which allowed me to create arrays that I could change at any time. I also used the 
scan library to allow the program to use user inputs within the program.

# Future Work

- One item I could improve in the future is to have the program write and store a file
- with all of the expenses so the user could see them in the future.

- The second item i could change is to clean up the expenses class and use inheritance and 
- other things to make the program more readable.

- Another part of the program I could change or add is more expense categories to all for a more 
- well rounded and user friendly program.
